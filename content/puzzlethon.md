### What is this?

Puzzlethon is an event where we write, test, and publish an entire puzzlehunt in 24 hours!

It's light-hearted, low-stakes, and a great way to get into writing puzzles if you're a Brown/RISD student.

We'll also be livestreaming the event. If you're curious about taking a look behind the scenes to see what goes into writing a puzzlehunt, check it out!

Making a puzzlehunt requires all kinds of people with many different skillsets: we need <span class="bold-text">writers</span>, <span class="bold-text">programmers</span>, <span class="bold-text">artists</span>, <span class="bold-text">testers</span>, and more. 

If you're interested in participating in Puzzlethon (and you're a Brown or RISD student), fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/62rNmpGzUkYPqN978)! If you're interested in spectating Puzzlethon, [watch our livestream when it goes live](https://youtube.com/live/sjQ9wiGR2C0)!

### What's a puzzlehunt?

A puzzlehunt is an event where teams of people compete to solve puzzles. These puzzles can be anything: word games, logic puzzles, video games, physical objects, or in-person challenges.

For a (much larger) example, take a look at last year's <a href="https://www.brownpuzzlehunt.com">Brown Puzzlehunt</a>.
